# MVP List

Recollecting Dairy, a Remember the Milk Clone, is a website for making fancy internet to-do lists. These lists can include things like getting milk from the store, returning a neighbor's borrowed cheese, throwing out a tub of expired yogurt, etc. Sometimes, lists can include tasks related to things that don't involve dairy at all, like American Cheese.
